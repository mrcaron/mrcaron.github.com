Hi.

I sling electrons for Dassault Systems, SolidWorks, but the opinions expressed in my blog are my own. So if I say something that doesn't jive right, come after me, not them. I write what I want, when I want and often it's geeky in nature. I like being outside and often wish I could program in a glass bubble outside in the grass. I love mountains, cycling (and often those two together), cooking, public speaking, history and art. Oh, and programming. I <3 GitHub, you can donate me a [hoodie](http://github.myshopify.com/products/invertocat-hoodie).

This blog is published automatically from [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using Mediator, a medium inspired Jekyll blog theme by [Dirk Fabisch](http://github.com/dirkfabisch), who uses the same theme on [his own blog](http://blog.base68.com).. The basic idea came from the Ghost theme [Readium 2.0](http://www.svenread.com/readium-ghost-theme/).
