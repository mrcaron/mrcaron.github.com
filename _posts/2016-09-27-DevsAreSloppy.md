title: "Developers are sloppy"
---

I'm reading [**The Phoenix Project**](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Phoenix_Project.html?id=_An-CAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false),
a novel about IT & DevOps. In the first chapter it was already incredible relatable. I'm going to be posting some quotes over the time I read it
because some of them are gems.

> A developer jamming in an urgent change so he could go on vacation... Situations like this only reinforce my deep suspicion of 
> developers: They're often carelessly breaking things and then disappearing, leaving Operations to clean up the mess.

- _The Phoenix Project_, Chapter 3, page 39

Can't tell you how many times I've been caught by this. "It's just a simple logging change, really, that _CAN'T_ have broken the system." 
Only to find out that it did. Shame shame I know your name.

This book, coupled with [**Continuous Delivery**](https://books.google.com/books?id=6ADDuzere-YC) (A Martin Fowler book, by Humble & Farley, Addison Wesley) is shaping my enterprise
knowledge more than ever.
