My Mattermost server bonked yesterday for no apparent reason. I couldn't get the docker container back up. Because I'm short on time,
I opted to head back to the land of TFS Team Chat (yuk). And because I just got a new box, my tampermonkey scripts were gone, so I didn't 
receive chat notifications. I had to re-write the javascript again because none of the Chrome Extensions work. So, here now, for posterity
I'm sharing it via [gist](
https://gist.github.com/mrcaron/bff0b2cdf5e50e8990491fc68f68d12c#file-tfsteamchatnotification-js).
